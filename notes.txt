show related stakeholders for each selected stakeholder (SH).
Relational mapping within Airtable? 


How do we protect the creation of relations and new map entries? With a log-in system? 

use shadcn dialog to allow creation of relationships between stakeholders. 


THe CreateStakeholderModal will be openable from the Stakeholder map page. 
(maybe open from elsewhere? Gets complicated with not just inserting my app into their website.)


The modal will include the StakeholderRelationForm to create a relationship between the selected
SH and others. 
From there, we need a dropdown list of all stakeholders, which will be filterable by name
Selecting from this list will push to an array (in State?) 
That array will then be passed to the API route used to create relations in the Airtable. 
The info container will need an extra section showing relations, 
and a mapmarker filter option to only show the selected record and its relations.
